    "# Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) Toronto Clean\n",

    "### Abstract:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection and kmean clusters were applied to help identify key contribution to fatal injury and neighbourhood in order to provide improvement and suggestions on how to improve.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set is a cleaned version of the Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) traffic accident reports from the City of Toronto Police Open Data portal. Inside is information for all traffic accidents reported between 2007 and 2017. There is data on the time, location, and the type of incident with various attributes about the traffic conditions at the time of the incident.\n",

    "    \n",
    "### Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto may not have the most friendly weather conditions and despite the best technologies, it is difficult to eliminate accidents caused by acts of nature. However, with greater safety precautions, right kind of education and higher prosecution rates, it would help increase road safety. Nowadays, driving safety has been a hot topic in the past few years as people from all walks of life travel to work by means of cars. Driving did indeed reduce time for transportation but its safety was a great concern. It came with a high speed that may not stop at the right timing to save life or accidents. Our interest would be to help Toronto district and neighbourhood to investigate cause of fatal injury and provide suggestions on how to reduce such fatal moments. \n",

But dark light in cluster 3 presented higher units among others and it is true that cluster 3 has the most fatal injury reported.\n",

    "In this modeling, several graph was used to explore relations inside the dataset. Column 'FATAL' was chozen as target output as it did not has missing value and in numeric format.In region-wise, Toronto east region was reported to be the most accidents ending up with fatal injury as showed in 2.4 section. Automobiles have been pretty consistent reason of accident over the years involving aggressive driving and pedestrians. AG_DRIV (Aggressive and Distracted Driving) are the major cause of accidents (62.9%), speeding accounts for 21.4%, redlight is 10.4% and alcohol is 5.3 % based on 2.5 section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then feature selection and cluster analysis was employed to reduce dimension and optimized for best modeling score. From feature selection, column like accnum, year, month, hoodID or name, weekday, minute and hour has great impact to modeling score and relation to fatal injury. But accnum, minute and hour did not has a lot business sense in real situation and in this modeling, thus was not selecting for final modeling. From elbow cluster method, 4 clusters was used to map the hoodname for final modeling to present which region result in more fatal injury and what is the cause behind it. In general, the results are not very significant that can demonstrate big reveral of the cause. But relative safer zone or dangerous area can be identified. Dark light, red light and freezing rain was found at slightly higher in the dangerous area that causing 0.05 unit more fatal injury than other areas. Those dangerous area are South parkdale, West humber-clairville and Wexford/Maryvale. Hood name in Cluster 4 and 2 was found to be relative safer zone in fatal injury.\n",

    "Regarding modeling-wise, pca was the best among all modeling for dimension reducing and modeling score but its drawback was obvious that it can't tell right away difference and that indicating real facotrs. It has to be done with PCA ratios in order to find out contribution for each features. Among all modeling and feature selection, 'Year' and 'Month' column greatly impact th modeling score. Column accident number, though not presenting real indication of fatal injury, plays a important role in affecting scores. So those year and month column were kept for modeling. Only selecting hoodname and other condition related column yield modeling score under or around 0.5 which will greatly impact our prediction for fatal injury. Selecting the final modeling with score 0.74 was the compromise between those factors. Finding a balance between real business model and theoretical prediction modeling was very interesting and sometimes complicated. \n",

    "In general, aggressive driving and speeding contribute greatly to fatal injury. But in dangerous neighborhood, dark light was found be to causing issues compared to other regions. \n",

    "For future work, if more numeric data was reported based on different condition, that will help us to understand the real business model. Ages for driver invloed in fatal injury was missed in the dataset that may replace the impact of accunum column and improve the modeling score. \n",
